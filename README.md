# AsifOS

AsifOS is a hobby project of mine, which was intended for learning purposes of how operating systems work. I always wondered what the heck happens under the hood when we use our computers. And I think I am blessed to learn those wonders of low level computing. This OS currently supports i386 architecture (x86_64 can handle the code, but not sure), and only supports BIOS boot for now.
